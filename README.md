# Fast-Responding Light Sensor / Radiometer

This repo contains the Gerber files for assembling a circuit for observing the amount of light power hitting a particular sensor (photodiode)
Note that two PCBs are required; a front PCB, and a rear PCB. The rear PCB contains just a hole for a coax connector (SMA female connector).

The front PCB contains the electronic parts on one side of the board, and the photodiode on the other side.

In-between the two PCBs is a small extruded aluminium case containing a battery holder, and two wires that interconnect the two PCBs.

## Files

(1) export-gerbers-s1223-rev1.zip - Contains the files for the front PCB, which is designed for a Hamamatsu S1223 phtodiode.

(2) export-gerber-pd-sma-rev1.zip - Contains the files for the rear PCB, which just has a hole for a SMA connector.

(3) export-gerbers-5mm-pd-rev1.zip - Contains an alternative front panel, suitable for 5 mm diameter photodiodes. If you use this board, then you don't need (1).
